In this project, I just grab ads from [vnexpress.net](https://vnexpress.net/) website as an example. You can change the ads to your own ads.

### Run locally

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add this:

```
API_RICK_AND_MORTY=https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql
```
then run:
```bash
yarn
yarn dev
```
